## Description

The purpose of this plugin is to enable users to safely update child themes without losing customizations made to the child theme. Since WordPress doesn\'t support grandchild themes (for good reason), this is one way to allow users to add custom PHP, CSS and JavaScript that won\'t be overwritten if a child theme is updated.
